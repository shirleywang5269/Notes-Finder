Brief Hospital Course:
The pt was admitted and started on IV AUnasyn, NPO, IVF. A CT
abdomen was performed to R/O biloma fromation which showed the
following:
No drainable fluid collections. Post surgical changes in the
gallbladder fossa. Calcified densities in the posterior liver,
below the level of the diaphragm/? calcified granulomas,
Prostatic enlargement, and small bilateral pleural effusions.

A HIDA scan was obtained on HD #2 which showed no evidence of
extravasation.  The ostomy bag draining bilious fluid over the R
post site steadily decreased throughout the [**Hospital **] hospital stay.
TB of the fluid was measured at the beginning and at the end of
the hospital course measuring 6.9 and 2.1 respectiveley.  The
pt's LFT's and PE were monitored throughout his stay and his
LFT's steadily improved throughout his hospital stay.  (see lab
result section).  With the pt's clinical improvement post
stenting and review of his cholab=ngiogram, it was thought that
the leak was most likely from the cystic duct stump.

The [**Hospital **] hospital course was remarkable for diarrhea.  CDIFF was
sent and was negative X 3.

The pt tolerated a regular diet, was voiding on his own,
abulating without difficulty, and had stable VS and an
unremarkable PE upon discharge. The pt was cleared by physicial
therapy and was DC'd on prophalyctic antibiotics
(ciprofloxacin)and with VNA for drain care.  The pt preferred to
have his follow up care done through the VA system but was to
return for a repeat ERCP in approximately 10 days.

Service:  CARDIAC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old gentleman
with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral
vascular disease, hypercholesterolemia, admitted to [**Hospital6 1760**] for cardiac catheterization
on [**2153-10-16**].  The patient had a two-month history of
dizziness and light-headedness.  Electrocardiogram at his
primary care physician's office showed a [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression
in leads V4 and V5.  The patient had a Persantine Thallium
test which revealed moderate to severe reversible apical
perfusion defect.  During this test, the patient developed ST
depressions in leads V3-V6, as well as chest pressure and arm
discomfort.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Coronary artery disease.  2.  Type
2 diabetes mellitus.  3.  Chronic renal insufficiency.  4.
Peripheral vascular disease.  5.  Status post left femoral to
pedal bypass.  6.  History of nephrolithiasis.  7.  Status
post bladder surgery.  8.  Status post transmetatarsal
amputation of the left third through fifth toes.  9.
Hypercholesterolemia.

ALLERGIES:  PERCOCET.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.,
Metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. q.d., Avandia 8 mg p.o. q.d.,
Glucotrol XL 10 mg p.o. q.d., Captopril 12.5 mg, Colace 100
mg p.o. b.i.d., Glucophage.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 6.6, hematocrit
27.6, platelet count 195; potassium 4.2, BUN 30, creatinine
1.3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Cardiac
Catheterization Lab on [**2153-10-16**].  The patient was
found to have borderline left ventricular ejection fraction,
80% mid left anterior descending, 80% proximal left
circumflex, 90% ostial RPDA.  The patient was referred to Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 10102**] for bypass surgery.

The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2153-10-18**], by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10102**] for coronary artery bypass grafting
times four, LIMA to proximal to left anterior descending,
saphenous vein graft to distal left anterior descending,
saphenous vein graft to OM1, saphenous vein graft to OM2.

Please see operative note for further details.  The patient
was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in stable
condition.

The patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical
ventilation on his first postoperative night.  The patient
required Neo-Synephrine to maintain adequate blood pressure,
as well as an Insulin drip.  The patient required
Neo-Synephrine infusion to maintain his blood pressure
through postoperative day #2.  He was weaned to off.  The
patient also had periods of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
and was begun on Amiodarone oral load.

The patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day
#2.  The patient was noted to have elevated blood glucose
levels and was ordered for his oral agents and Insulin
sliding scale; however, the patient on postoperative day #3,
received his full sliding scale coverage.  The patient
continued to have blood glucose levels.  The patient was
preoperatively followed by the [**Hospital **] Clinic.  Per the
physician orders, the patient was to be restarted on his full
oral agents and regular Insulin sliding scale.  The patient
eventually agreed.

The patient began working with Physical Therapy to increase
ambulation and tolerated this well.  On postoperative day #5,
the patient was cleared for discharge to a rehabilitation
facility.
