# Notes Finder

Reaches out to Doctor's Notes and displays a dashboard that allows the user to search for various words. 

Node version: 8.12

- `frontend/` creates the react frontend application. `cd` into the folder and run `yarn start` in order to launch the frontend. Modification: In the `Notes.tsx` file, there is a function called searchClicked(). Feel free to modify that with a fetch() request to the localhost backend server. That should return a list of new words
